        <h1>Private Notice</h1>

        <p class="text-dark lh-base">Our privacy notice informs you of what to expect when the Financial Conduct
            Authority (FCA) collects information about individuals (which we will call ‘personal data’ in this privacy
            notice). The FCA is the controller responsible for the processing of your personal data.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            To help you understand how we use personal data across the FCA, in this privacy notice we explain core
            activities that we undertake and how we may use the personal data that we collect to carry out these
            activities. We also provide information about your rights and how to contact us if you have any questions.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The FCA may at times process personal data as a joint controller (such as, under section 166 of FSMA, where
            we make joint decisions around processing personal data with Skilled Persons or with the Prudential
            Regulation Authority (PRA)) or as a separate controller (where we share personal data) with other
            authorities (such as the PRA).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In most cases, individuals can still exercise their rights in relation to the personal data we process as
            set out below. Where we will allocate responsibilities between the controllers and we will, if necessary,
            notify or redirect individuals to other authority or controller, in relation to exercising their individual
            rights.
